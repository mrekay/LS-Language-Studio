LSL Studio is a language studio application written in C#, designed to facilitate language management for multi-lingual applications.
<br>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
After selecting a project in the application, you need to create languages within the project. For example: English, French, Turkish... Once you have created the languages, you can import JSON data files or manually enter the data.
